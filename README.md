# axion_mag
Code for computing axion electrodynamics.

## Features
- Sophisticated algorithm with extended Yee (staggered) grid 
- Explicit and implicit symplectic integrators
- Error monitoring based on constraints equations
- MPI-OpenMP hybrid parallelism with special optimization in many-core architecture (e.g. Intel Xeon Phi).
